The day before (or morning of) you should block the channel. Take Blocking BSA and Blocking Solution from the -20. There are aliquots that have been filtered. Mix each of them together, 500 uL of each.


Adjust the PDMS so it sits flat and the first two channels are exposed. Use a razor blad eto make sure that the UV glue is perfectly flat against the cover Use a 20 ul tip to block the other channels, sealing the end of the tip with a little bit of Silicone glue.

Now put an empty 200 ul tip on one side of the channel and then fill the other side of the channel with 200 ul of PBS 1x. Then pull out the one that received the fluid. Take out any solution that has accumulated in the holes with a a pipette.

Add 10 uL of the 1:1 BSA Blocking:Blocking Solution, using a 20 ul pipeette tip. Note: when adding, make sure to take out the 10 ul and let the pipette sit at room temperature for a few minutes so that the fluid enters the channel warmed. If the fluid enters the channel while the fluid is still cold, then it will promote bubble formation. Donâ€™t warm up the entire 1 mL of the 1:1 solution though, as it is not supposed to be stable at room temperature.

Take the channel to the microscope room with Traptavidin (2 mg/ml). First,
